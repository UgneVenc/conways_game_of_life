# conways_game_of_life
recreation of Conway's game of life in C++ 
Implamented a 2D array (grid), loops, void function and generation count

Rules of Conway's game of life:
- Any living cell with fewer than two alive neighbors dies (underpopulation)
- Any alive cell with more than three alive neighboors dies (ovepopulation)
- Any dead cell who has exatly 3 neighbors becomes alive (reproduction)

I demonstraited as alive and dead ass a boolean array (true - alive, false - dead)
